Introduction
============

This document contains the documentation for the tallies used in the `Immanuelkapel in Oostendam <https://kerkdienstgemist.nl/stations/2112-Immanuelkapel>`_. 
The goal in this project is to provide *cheap* indicator lights to show which camera is active during the service.
This way the minister knows which of the camera's is active and use it during the service.

This project relies heavily on an `existing project on github <https://github.com/wifi-tally/wifi-tally/>`_. 
The main difference between this code and the project on github is the behaviour of the tally lights.
